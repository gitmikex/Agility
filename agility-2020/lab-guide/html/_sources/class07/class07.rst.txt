Class 7: Dude Where's My Services: Introduction to Service Discovery with Consul
================================================================================

During this lab you will make use of Terraform to deploy a BIG-IP, Consul
Server, and NGINX nodes.

Once these devices are deployed you will use Terraform to install AS3
onto the BIG-IP and deploy an AS3 declaration to use Consul for Service
Discovery to create a pool of the NGINX nodes.

You will then modify the Auto-Scale group of NGINX nodes to observe how
Consul get detect the new NGINX nodes and the BIG-IP will also be updated.
