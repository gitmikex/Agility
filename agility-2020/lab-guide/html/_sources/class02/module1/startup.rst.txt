Starting the Lab
----------------

In order to complete this lab, you will connect to a Windows jump host, and you
will perform all steps from there.  In the instructions below, there are steps
to connect to that jump host first, then you will complete the other steps from
there. You can open the lab guide from the Windows jump host in order to make
it easier to follow the rest of the lab.
